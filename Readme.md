# RexTheme Plugin Boilerplate

## Contents

The `plugin_name` directory contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs.

* Copy plugin_name to your plugin's directory and rename it to your plugin's name
* Perform a find and replace at the project level as follows:
  1. Find the text `plugin_name` and replace with `your-plugin-name` in all files
  2. Find the text `PLUGIN_NAME` and replace with `PLUGIN_NAME` in all files
